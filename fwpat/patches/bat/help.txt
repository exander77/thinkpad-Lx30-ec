The xx30 Series of Thinkpads unfortunately incorporate some kind of battery
check that makes it impossible to use an aftermarket and/or xx20 series
battery, even though i.e. T420 battery will perfectly fit into xx30 and
also works.
The reason is some kind of challenge/response battery authentication mechanism
in the embedded controller. This was discovered by Dr. Matthew Chapman for his
X230T Thinkpad and very well documented in his blog:

Unfortunately, the Thinkpad L430 and L530 series use a different embededd
controller (Nuvoton NPCE885G), so this patch was written.
This is a recommended patch.
